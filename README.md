# Titanic_Survival_Prediction
In this project, we use Python and scikit-learn to predict passenger survival on the Titanic. We preprocess the dataset, select relevant features, and train a Logistic Regression model to predict survival outcomes. The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy and other relevant metrics
